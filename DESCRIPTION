Description: Computes coordinate transformations of the form 
    (y1, y2) = (f1(x1, x2), f2(x1, x2)) for spatial regression, 
    where a spatial process Y on (y1, y2) has known stationary 
    covariance function. The functions f1 and f2 are obtained
    via the tensor product of B-splines, with a regularization
    penalty to ensure f1, f2 are injective functions. The case 
    for Y Gaussian with Matern covariance is implemented, as 
    well as documentation for extensions to different spatial 
    covariance functions.
